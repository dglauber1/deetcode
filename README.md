# deetcode
DeetCode is the final project of Brown University's Intro to Software Engineering class.

Project idea, specifications, design, and implementation were by Daniel Glauber, Edward Li, Eddie Lee, and Tyler Hakomori (DEET).

In short, DeetCode is a website that provides a coding interface for users to attempt programming challenges. Its purpose is to make coding fun by gamifying the coding challenges typically found on sites like HackerRank and LeetCode.

Some of the main features of DeetCode:

* A programming interface for users to write their own code in a variety of languages to solve programming challenges. Users may compile and run their own code against custom test cases, and will provide feedback based on how their solutions did against the DeetCode test cases.

* A leaderboard that users may reach if their solutions rank best based on code efficiency, brevity, and time-to-completion. The leaderboard also features graphs so a user may measure how their solution ranks in comparison to those of other users.

* User profile creation using Facebook authentication.

* An admin dashboard that allows for the addition of new coding challenges and their corresponding test cases.

The project uses SparkJava and was completed in roughly a month.
